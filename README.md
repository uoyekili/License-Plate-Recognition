# License Plate Recognition

A deep learning system for automatic license plate detection and recognition.

---

## Overview

This project applies **Ultralytics YOLO** for license plate detection and a **PyTorch-based OCR model** for character recognition, supported by **OpenCV** and **NumPy**.

* **Performance**: Achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set of 400 samples, with all license plates correctly recognized.
* **Evaluation**: Extensive visualizations and detailed analysis are available in the data directory.

## Results

Comprehensive evaluation outputs are available in [`dataset_test/outputs`](./dataset_test/outputs).
Real-world test videos are available in [`videos`](./videos/), showcasing system performance under various conditions.

Below are a few illustrative examples:
